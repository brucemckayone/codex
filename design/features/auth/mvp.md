# Authentication & User Management MVP Definition

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) requirements for the authentication and user system are:

## 1. Core Authentication

- Email/password registration for new users
- Email/password login for existing users
- Secure password hashing and storage
- Password reset via email (forgot password)
- Basic session management (login/logout)
- Email verification (optional for MVP, but recommended)
- Minimal user profile (name, email)

## 2. Role System

- Simple role-based access system with at least:
  - Platform Owner (admin/business operator)
  - Customer (end user/content purchaser)
- Role assignment at registration or via admin panel
- Enforce role-appropriate access to platform features

## 3. User Flows

- Register new account (as Platform Owner or Customer)
- Log in to existing account
- Reset forgotten password (via email link/code)
- Log out of current session

## 4. MVP Success Criteria

- Platform Owner is able to register, log in, and access admin/content management
- Customer is able to register, log in, and access content purchase/browsing features
- Secure protection of user credentials
- No unauthorized cross-role access

## 5. Non-Goals for MVP (to be deferred to later phases)

- Social login (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Multi-factor authentication
- Advanced RBAC (Media Owners, Platform Creator/Developer, role inheritance, permission granularity)
- Impersonation features
- User analytics, audit logs
- GDPR data export/delete tools
- OAuth integrations

**Summary:**  
For the MVP, focus on a secure, email-based authentication system supporting two roles (Platform Owner and Customer) with simple flows for registration, login, and password reset. This enables platform launch and all core transactions, while deferring advanced auth features to future phases.
