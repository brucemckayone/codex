# Admin Dashboard - Phase 1 PRD

## Feature Summary

The Admin Dashboard provides the Platform Owner with a centralized interface to manage content, customers, and view essential business analytics. It is designed to be intuitive and enable the Platform Owner to operate the platform independently without technical assistance.

**Key Concept**: A single pane of glass for the Platform Owner to oversee and manage their entire content monetization business.

## Problem Statement

The Platform Owner needs a way to:
- Efficiently manage their uploaded content (videos, audio, written).
- Oversee customer accounts and their purchase history.
- Track key business metrics like revenue and sales performance.
- Customize basic platform branding and settings.

Without a functional admin dashboard, the Platform Owner cannot effectively operate their business, leading to reliance on developers for day-to-day tasks and a lack of insight into platform performance.

## Goals / Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
1.  **Content Management**: Enable Platform Owners to list, create, edit, publish, and delete content.
2.  **Customer Management**: Provide tools to view customer details and their purchase history.
3.  **Simple Analytics**: Display key business metrics (total revenue, customer count, top content).
4.  **Basic Settings**: Allow customization of platform branding and business information.

### Success Metrics
- Platform Owner can perform content CRUD operations in < 30 seconds.
- Platform Owner can find a customer and view their purchase history in < 15 seconds.
- Key analytics (total revenue) are visible within 5 seconds of logging in.
- Platform Owner can update branding (logo, color) in < 1 minute.
- 90% of Platform Owner's daily operational tasks can be completed via the dashboard without developer intervention.

## Scope

### In Scope (Phase 1 MVP)
- **Content Management Section**:
  - List all content (published, unpublished, processing) with basic filters (e.g., by status).

  - Toggle content publish/unpublish status.

- **Full Platform Settings** (SEO, integrations, custom domains) (Phase 3+)
- **User Impersonation** (Phase 3)
- **Bulk Actions** (e.g., bulk publish, bulk delete) (Phase 2)
- **Refund Initiation** (handled by E-Commerce feature, dashboard links to it) (Phase 1)
