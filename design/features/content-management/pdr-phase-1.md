# Content Management - Phase 1 PRD

## Feature Summary

Content management system for Creators to upload, organize, and manage video and audio content. Phase 1 focuses on core CRUD operations with media library separation, Cloudflare R2 storage via bucket-per-creator architecture, and metadata management in Neon Postgres.

**Key Concept**: Content entities reference media items (videos/audio) stored in the media library. This separation allows content pricing/packaging while media items handle storage and transcoding.

## Problem Statement

Creators need a way to:

- Upload video content (MP4, WebM, MOV) for courses, tutorials, or media libraries
- Upload audio content (MP3, M4A, WAV) for podcasts or audio lessons
- Organize content with metadata (title, description, categories, tags)
- Manage content lifecycle (draft, published, archived)
- Store media files securely in isolated creator buckets
- Prepare content for sale via e-commerce integration
- Attach downloadable resources (PDFs, workbooks) to content

Without content management:

- No way to add content to the platform
- No inventory for e-commerce purchases
- No content library for customers to access
- Platform is empty shell with no value

## Goals / Success Criteria

### Primary Goals

1. **Upload Video Content** - Creators can upload video files (MP4, WebM, MOV)
2. **Upload Audio Content** - Creators can upload audio files (MP3, M4A, WAV)
3. **Media Library Pattern** - Separate media storage from content metadata
4. **Metadata Management** - Add titles, descriptions, thumbnails, categories, pricing
5. **Content Organization** - Categorize and tag content for discovery
6. **Lifecycle Management** - Draft, publish, archive workflow
7. **Resource Attachments** - Attach PDFs/workbooks to content (reusable across content)
8. **Storage Integration** - Use Cloudflare R2 bucket-per-creator for scalable storage

### Success Metrics

- Creator can upload 1GB video file in < 5 minutes
- Uploaded media appears in media library immediately
- Content can reference existing media items (no re-upload)
- Metadata stored in database with correct relationships
- Files stored in creator-specific R2 buckets with proper access control
- Published content appears in customer catalog (after purchase)
- Draft content hidden from customers
- 100% pass rate on content management unit tests

## Scope

### In Scope (Phase 1 MVP)

- **Video Content**:
  - MP4, WebM, MOV formats
  - Direct upload to creator's R2 media bucket
  - Progress tracking for large files (up to 5GB)
  - Custom thumbnail upload (or auto-generated via transcoding)
  - Original files stored in R2 (transcoding handled separately)
- **Audio Content**:
  - MP3, M4A, WAV formats
  - Direct upload to creator's R2 media bucket
  - Progress tracking
  - Duration metadata extraction
- **Media Library**:
  - Separate `media_items` table for uploaded files
  - Content references media items (many-to-one relationship)
  - Media items can be reused across multiple content entities
  - Media status tracking (uploading, uploaded, transcoding, ready, failed)
- **Content Metadata**:
  - Title, description
  - Content type (video, audio)
  - Single category per content
  - Multiple tags
  - Pricing information (for e-commerce integration)
  - Media item reference (contentId → mediaId)
- **Resource Attachments**:
  - Attach PDFs, workbooks, files to content
  - Resources stored in creator's R2 resource bucket
  - Reusable resources (one resource → many content items)
  - See [R2 Bucket Structure](../../infrastructure/R2BucketStructure.md) for details
- **Content Lifecycle**:
  - Draft state (hidden from customers)
  - Published state (available for purchase/access)
  - Archived state (no longer available)
- **Admin UI**:
  - Media library view (uploaded videos/audio)
  - Content list (table view)
  - Create/edit content form (select from media library)
  - File upload component with progress
  - Content preview
  - Resource attachment management
- **Storage**:
  - Cloudflare R2 bucket-per-creator architecture
  - Neon Postgres for metadata
  - Presigned URLs for secure file access

### Explicitly Out of Scope (Future Phases)

- **Written articles/PDFs as content** - Phase 2 (Phase 1 is video + audio only)
- **Video transcoding (HLS, multi-quality)** - Phase 1 but separate feature ([Media Transcoding](../media-transcoding/pdr-phase-1.md))
- **Automatic thumbnail generation** - Phase 1 but handled in Media Transcoding feature
- **Content versioning** - Phase 3
- **Collaborative editing** - Phase 3
- **Content scheduling (publish at specific time)** - Phase 2
- **Bulk upload (multiple files at once)** - Phase 2
- **Advanced media library features (folders, galleries)** - Phase 2
- **Content analytics (views, engagement)** - Phase 2
- **Advanced search/filtering** - Phase 2 (basic filtering in Phase 1)
- **Subtitles/captions** - Phase 3
- **DRM/content protection** - Phase 3

## User Stories & Use Cases

### US-CONTENT-001: Upload Video to Media Library

**As a** Creator
**I want to** upload video files to my media library
**So that** I can create content that references these videos

**Flow:**

1. Creator navigates to `/admin/media/upload`
2. Creator clicks "Upload Video" button
3. Creator selects MP4 file from computer (500MB)
4. System:
   - Validates file type (MP4, WebM, MOV) and size (max 5GB)
   - Requests presigned upload URL from backend
   - Backend generates R2 presigned URL for `codex-media-{creatorId}/originals/{mediaId}/original.mp4`
   - Shows upload progress bar
   - Uploads directly to creator's R2 media bucket
5. On upload complete:
   - Frontend notifies backend: `POST /api/media/upload-complete`
   - Backend creates `media_items` record:
     - `id = {mediaId}`
     - `owner_id = {creatorId}`
     - `type = 'video'`
     - `status = 'uploaded'`
     - `bucket_name = 'codex-media-{creatorId}'`
     - `file_key = 'originals/{mediaId}/original.mp4'`
   - Backend enqueues transcoding job (see [Media Transcoding](../media-transcoding/pdr-phase-1.md))
   - `media_items.status` updated to `'transcoding'`
6. Creator sees media item in media library with status "Transcoding..."
7. When transcoding completes, status updates to "Ready"

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Video file uploaded to creator's R2 bucket successfully
- Progress bar shows accurate upload percentage
- `media_items` record created with correct metadata

## Notes

### Why Media Library Pattern?

- **Reusability**: One video → many content items (different pricing/bundles)
- **Separation of Concerns**: Media storage/transcoding separate from content metadata
- **Flexibility**: Swap media items without recreating content
- **Cost Efficiency**: No file duplication in R2
- **Future-Proof**: Easier to add media management features (folders, galleries)

### Why Bucket-Per-Creator?

- **Isolation**: Each creator's files physically separated
- **Security**: Compromised creator doesn't affect others
- **Permissions**: Easier creator-specific access control
- **Billing**: Track storage costs per creator
- **Scale**: Cloudflare allows 1 million buckets

### Why Reusable Resources?

- **Cost Efficiency**: Same workbook used across multiple offerings/content → stored once
- **Consistency**: Update resource once, all attachments reflect change
- **Flexibility**: Resources can attach to content, offerings, courses (extensible)

### Content vs Media Items vs Resources

| Entity         | Purpose                               | Storage                     | Reusability                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Media Item** | Uploaded video/audio file             | R2 (originals + HLS)        | Yes - multiple content items     |
| **Content**    | Sellable package (pricing + metadata) | Database (references media) | N/A                              |
| **Resource**   | Downloadable file (PDF, workbook)     | R2 (resources bucket)       | Yes - multiple content/offerings |

### File Upload Strategy

**Direct browser → R2 upload via presigned URL**:

1. Browser requests upload URL from backend: `POST /api/media/presigned-upload`
2. Backend generates R2 presigned PUT URL for creator's bucket
3. Browser uploads directly to R2 (progress tracking)
4. On complete, browser notifies backend: `POST /api/media/upload-complete`
5. Backend creates `media_items` record and enqueues transcoding job

**Benefits**:

- No file passes through SvelteKit server (saves bandwidth)
- Upload progress tracked client-side
- Scalable (R2 handles upload load)
- Works with Cloudflare Workers/Pages (no filesystem access needed)
