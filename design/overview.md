# Overview

This is the high-level requirements document for a white-label creator platform. This document captures the core business requirements and stakeholder needs that will drive all technical design and implementation decisions.

## Purpose

Define the highest-level requirements for a multi-stakeholder platform that enables creators to monetize their knowledge through an upsell funnel: consumable media → events → one-on-one services.

## Platform Vision

A creator knowledge hub where non-technical platform owners can build a complete business ecosystem including:

- Content monetization (videos, audio, written content)
- Event hosting (live streaming, in-person)
- Service booking (appointments, recurring sessions)
- Multi-creator marketplace with revenue sharing

The platform creates a customer journey from passive content consumption to active personal engagement with creators.

# Core Business Requirements

## 1. Multi-Stakeholder Role-Based Access

The platform must support four distinct user types with appropriate permissions and capabilities.

## 2. Content Management & Monetization

Enable creation, organization, and sale of multiple media types with flexible pricing and bundling options.

## 3. Offering Management System

Support creation and delivery of all purchasable engagements (events, services, programs, retreats) through a unified system with dedicated customer portals for each engagement.

## 4. Flexible Monetization Model

Support multiple access methods: direct purchases, category-based subscription tiers with credits, and progressive pricing to drive customer engagement from low-commitment entry to high-value relationships.

## 5. Revenue Sharing Infrastructure

Implement payment processing with automatic revenue splits between Platform Owner and Media Owners via Stripe Connect.

## 6. Non-Technical User Experience

All platform management must be accessible to users without technical knowledge.

## 7. Content Delivery Infrastructure

Reliable streaming and file delivery for video, audio, and document content.

## 8. Authentication & Authorization

Secure user authentication with role-based access control and payment account integration.

## 9. Customer Purchase & Access

Complete e-commerce flow for browsing, purchasing, and accessing content and offerings with clear visibility into subscription benefits and credit balances.

# Stakeholders

The platform serves four distinct user types, each with specific needs and access levels.

## 1. Platform Creator (Developer/Admin)

**Role**: System administrator and developer

### R2.2 Pricing & Monetization

**Requirement**: Create a flexible monetization system that supports individual purchases, subscription tiers, and credit-based access to drive progressive customer engagement from low-commitment entry points to high-value relationships.

#### Access Model Overview

The platform supports three primary ways customers can access content and offerings:

1. **Direct Purchase**: One-time payment for permanent access to specific content or participation in specific offerings
2. **Subscription Tiers**: Recurring payment for ongoing access to categories of content, offerings, and/or monthly credits
3. **Credits**: Redeemable tokens (earned through subscriptions or purchased) that can be spent on bookable offerings

#### Detailed Capabilities

**Direct Purchase Management**

- Set individual prices for any content or offering
- Offer content/offerings for free (promotional or lead magnets)
- Create one-time bundles (e.g., "All meditation videos" for $99)
- Set early-bird pricing for offerings with scheduled dates
- Configure limited-time pricing promotions

**Subscription Tier Configuration**
Platform Owner can create multiple subscription tiers, each defining:

_Access to Content Categories_

- Grant access to all content in specific categories (e.g., "Yoga Tier" includes all yoga videos)
- Grant access to all content across all categories (VIP tier)
- Mix and match category access per tier

_Access to Offerings_

- Include specific offering types (e.g., "free access to all live workshops")
- Include all offerings up to a certain capacity (e.g., "join any group session")
- Include specific offerings by name

_Monthly Credits_

- Grant credits monthly that can be spent on bookable offerings
- Examples:
  - "2 therapy session credits per month" (2 credits = 2 one-on-one sessions)
  - "5 class credits per month" (use for any group class)
- Define credit expiration rules (expire monthly, rollover, accumulate)
- Define which offerings can be booked with credits vs requiring payment

_Pricing Options_

- Monthly vs annual billing (with annual discount option)
- Introductory pricing for first month/year
- Free trial periods (7 days, 30 days)
- Family/group pricing (one subscription, multiple user accounts)

**Credit System**

- Customers can purchase credit packs (e.g., "10 class credits for $150")
- Subscription tiers grant credits monthly
- Platform Owner defines credit value for each offering (e.g., "1-on-1 yoga = 1 credit", "retreat day = 3 credits")
- Credits create urgency ("use them or lose them") and exclusivity
- Credit balance visible in customer dashboard
- Notification system for expiring credits

**Pricing Strategy Tools**

- Copy pricing from one content/offering to another
- Bulk pricing updates (e.g., "set all beginner yoga to $9.99")
- A/B testing different price points (Phase 4)
- Promotional codes and discounts:
  - Percentage off (20% off)
  - Fixed amount off ($10 off)
  - First-time customer offers
  - Referral discounts
  - Category-specific codes ("YOGALOVE" for yoga content)

**Payment Configuration**

- Connect Stripe account
- Configure accepted payment methods (card, digital wallets)
- Set platform currency (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)
- Tax settings (automatic tax calculation by region)
- Invoice generation for business customers

**Progressive Engagement Model**

The pricing system enables a deliberate customer journey:

1. **Discovery** (Free/Low Cost): Free content, lead magnets, $5-10 individual pieces
2. **Sampling** (Low Commitment): $29/month basic subscription to one category, trial periods
3. **Engagement** (Medium Commitment): $79/month tier with multiple categories + 2 session credits
4. **Deep Relationship** (High Commitment): $299/month VIP with full access + weekly 1-on-1 sessions
5. **Transformation** (Highest Value): Custom coaching packages, retreats, ongoing mentorship

The platform should make step 1 → 2 frictionless, while creating natural upsell opportunities at each stage.

#### Revenue Attribution Strategy

**Direct Purchases**

- Simple attribution: Revenue split according to Media Owner agreement (e.g., 70/30)
- Clear, immediate payout calculation

**Subscription Revenue** (Choose One Strategy)

_Option A: Platform Owner Keeps All Subscription Revenue (Recommended for MVP)_

- Simplest to implement and understand
- Subscription revenue goes 100% to Platform Owner
- Media Owners earn only from direct purchases of their content
- Clear separation: subscriptions = Platform Owner income, direct sales = shared income
- Incentivizes Platform Owner to drive subscription growth
- **Trade-off**: May reduce Media Owner motivation if most revenue comes from subscriptions

_Option B: Engagement-Based Revenue Split (Recommended for Phase 2+)_

- Track which content/offerings each subscriber engages with
- Monthly pool: Take subscription revenue, subtract platform costs
- Distribute to Media Owners based on:
  - Content views/play time (weighted by completion rate)
  - Offering participation (attendance, bookings fulfilled)
  - Rating/feedback scores (quality bonus)
- Example: $10,000 subscription revenue this month
  - Media Owner A's content: 30% of total engagement = $3,000
  - Media Owner B's content: 20% of total engagement = $2,000
  - Media Owner C's content: 10% of total engagement = $1,000
  - Platform Owner: 40% (admin + unattributed) = $4,000
- **Trade-off**: Complex to calculate, requires robust analytics, potential disputes

_Option C: Hybrid Model_

- Subscription revenue: 80% Platform Owner, 20% split among Media Owners based on engagement
- Balances simplicity with Media Owner incentives
- **Trade-off**: Still requires engagement tracking

**Credit-Based Bookings**

- When a customer uses credits (from subscription) to book a Media Owner's offering:
  - Attribute a pro-rated amount from their subscription fee to that Media Owner
  - OR treat as Platform Owner revenue (since it's part of subscription benefit)
- Recommendation: Treat as Platform Owner revenue for MVP simplicity

**Decision for MVP**: Start with **Option A** (Platform Owner keeps subscription revenue). This allows you to launch quickly with simple revenue logic. Add engagement-based attribution in Phase 2 when you have analytics infrastructure and real usage patterns to inform the model.

#### Analytics & Reporting

Platform Owner can view:

- Revenue by source (direct purchases vs subscriptions vs credits)
- Subscription metrics:
  - MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
  - Churn rate
  - Average subscription lifetime
  - Conversion rate (free user → subscriber)
- Credit usage patterns:
  - Credits issued vs credits redeemed
  - Most popular offerings booked with credits
  - Credit expiration rates
- Pricing effectiveness:
  - Conversion rates by price point
  - Bundle vs individual purchase rates
  - Discount code redemption rates
- Customer lifetime value (CLV)
- Revenue per customer segment

**Success Criteria**:

- Platform Owner can create their first subscription tier (with categories + credits) in under 10 minutes
- Customers can understand their access level and credit balance within 5 seconds of logging in
- Revenue attribution is automated and transparent to all Media Owners
- Pricing changes take effect immediately across the platform

### R2.3 Offering Management

**Requirement**: Create and manage any type of purchasable engagement (events, services, programs, retreats) through a unified "Offering" system that provides customers with dedicated portals containing all resources, scheduling, and communication for their engagement.

#### Core Concept: What is an Offering?

An **Offering** is any bookable or scheduled engagement between creator and customer(s). Unlike passive content (videos, articles), Offerings are interactive experiences that may include:

- Scheduled sessions (one-time or recurring)
- Live interaction (video calls, in-person meetings, streaming)
- Associated resources (content, files, materials)
- Customer portal (engagement-specific hub for everything related to this offering)
- Communication channel (direct messaging, group chat)

Offerings replace the traditional separation of "Events" and "Services" because they share more similarities than differences.

#### Offering Types

Platform Owners can create offerings in these categories:

**1. One-Time Event**

- Single scheduled occurrence (webinar, workshop, concert, masterclass)
- Can accommodate: 1 person, small group, large group, or unlimited attendees
- Example: "Intro to Meditation Workshop - March 15th, 7pm"

**2. Multi-Day Event/Program**

- Spans multiple days with a schedule of sessions
- Can include daily sessions, breaks, activities
- Example: "5-Day Yoga Retreat - June 10-14"
- Example: "21-Day Transformation Program" with scheduled check-ins

**3. Recurring Service - Fixed Schedule**

- Ongoing engagement with predefined recurring schedule
- Example: "Weekly Group Coaching - Every Tuesday at 6pm"
- Example: "Monthly Healing Circle - First Saturday of each month"

**4. Recurring Service - Bookable**

- Ongoing engagement where customer books individual sessions from availability
- Example: "1-on-1 Therapy Sessions" (customer books from therapist's available slots)
- Example: "Personal Training" (customer books 2x/week from available times)

**5. Course/Program with Cohort**

- Structured multi-week program with defined curriculum
- Customers join specific cohorts with start/end dates
- Example: "8-Week Mindfulness Course - Cohort starting April 1st"

**6. Retreat/Immersive**

- Multi-day in-person or intensive online experience
- Includes accommodation, meals, materials, full schedule
- Example: "Silent Meditation Retreat - Bali, 10 days"

## Decision Framework

When deciding whether a feature belongs in MVP or later phases, ask:

### Critical Questions

1. **Can the platform function without it?** If no → MVP
2. **Does it directly enable the core transaction (content sale)?** If yes → MVP
3. **Is it required for legal/security compliance?** If yes → MVP
4. **Can it be done manually/workaround initially?** If yes → Later phase
5. **Does it serve <10% of users initially?** If yes → Later phase

### Examples Applied

**Feature: Video transcoding to multiple qualities**

- Can platform function without it? Yes, single quality works
- Does it enable core transaction? No, just enhances it
- Can it be done manually? Platform Owner can optimize videos before upload
- **Decision**: Phase 2 or 3

**Feature: Payment processing**

- Can platform function without it? No, this is the business model
- Does it enable core transaction? Yes, absolutely
- Required for compliance? Yes, need secure payment handling
- **Decision**: Phase 1 MVP

**Feature: Content comments**

- Can platform function without it? Yes
- Does it enable core transaction? No, nice to have for engagement
- Serves <10% initially? Yes, only valuable with community
- **Decision**: Phase 4

# Conclusion

This document provides the highest-level requirements for your creator platform. The core value proposition is creating an **upsell funnel from passive content consumption to active creator engagement**, while supporting multiple creators through a **revenue-sharing marketplace model**.

The platform combines:

- **LMS** (content management and delivery)
- **E-commerce** (payments and subscriptions)
- **Event management** (live streaming and ticketing)
- **Booking system** (appointment scheduling)
- **Multi-tenant marketplace** (Platform Owner + Media Owners)

By following the phased approach (MVP → Enhanced Monetization → Multi-Creator → Advanced Features), you can deliver value quickly while building toward a comprehensive platform.

**Key Success Factor**: Keep the Platform Owner experience simple and intuitive. They are non-technical and need to manage everything without developer assistance. Every feature should pass the "can a non-technical user do this independently?" test.
