# Codex Platform - Complete Overview

**Purpose**: A single, comprehensive reference document that explains what Codex is, who it's for, and how it works—in plain English, with no technical jargon.

**Last Updated**: November 7, 2025

---

## What Is Codex?

Codex is a **creator monetization platform** that helps people sell their knowledge and expertise online. Think of it as your own Netflix + Calendly + Shopify, all in one—but designed specifically for creators, coaches, teachers, and consultants.

The platform creates a journey for your customers:
1. **Discover** → Watch free or low-cost videos
2. **Learn** → Buy courses or subscribe to your content library
3. **Engage** → Attend your workshops and events
4. **Transform** → Book one-on-one coaching or mentorship

---

## Who Uses Codex?

### Four Types of People

**1. Platform Owner (The Developer)**
- You—the person who built and maintains the system
- You have complete access to everything, but you don't run any businesses on it
- Think of this as being the "landlord" of a building where businesses operate
- You can see all the data, manage all the settings, but you're not creating content or selling anything

**2. Creators (Independent Media Owners)**
- Independent people who create and own their media (videos, audio files, courses)
- Examples: A yoga instructor, a cooking teacher, a business coach
- **They own their media library**—their videos and audio files belong to them forever
- They can work independently OR collaborate with organizations
- In the future (Phase 2+), they can license their content to multiple organizations

**What makes a creator?**
- They upload videos and audio to their own personal media library
- They decide what to do with their content
- They can sell on their own personal profile
- They can collaborate with organizations and share revenue
- Their files stay in their storage even if they stop working with an organization

**3. Organizations (Business Operators)**
- Groups or businesses that work with creators
- Examples: A yoga studio collective, a coaching academy, an online learning platform
- Organizations are run by an **Organization Owner** (who is ALSO a creator)
- Organizations can feature content from multiple creators (Phase 2+)
- They have their own branded storefront/website

**Key distinction**:
- **Creators** = people who own media
- **Organizations** = businesses/collectives who sell media (including from multiple creators)

**4. Customers**
- Regular people who buy courses, attend workshops, or book coaching sessions
- They don't need any special access—they just browse, buy, and consume
- They see content from organizations or from individual creators

---

## Understanding Creators and Organizations

### The Relationship

Think of it like this:

**Creators are musicians. Organizations are record labels.**

- A musician (creator) owns their songs (media)
- They can release songs independently on their own profile
- OR they can work with a record label (organization) who promotes and sells their music
- The musician still owns the songs—the label just gets a cut of sales
- A musician can work with multiple labels (Phase 2+)

### In Codex Terms

**Sarah is a yoga instructor (creator)**:
- She records 50 yoga videos
- These videos live in HER media library (she owns them)
- She can do THREE things with her videos:

1. **Sell Independently**
   - Post videos on her personal creator profile
   - Set her own prices
   - Keep 100% of revenue (minus platform fees)
   - Example: "30-Day Yoga Challenge - $49"

2. **Work with an Organization**
   - She joins "Peaceful Mind Yoga Studio" (an organization)
   - She allows them to feature her videos in their catalog
   - The organization sets the pricing and branding
   - Sarah gets a percentage of each sale (Phase 2+ feature)
   - Example: The studio bundles her videos with other instructors as "Complete Beginner Series - $99"

3. **Both at Once** (Phase 2+)
   - Same video can appear on her personal profile for $10
   - AND in the yoga studio's premium package for $99 (bundled with other content)
   - She earns revenue from both places

**The key**: Sarah's videos always stay in HER library. Organizations can't take them away.

### Phase 1 Simplification

In Phase 1, we're building for:
- **One organization**
- Run by **one organization owner** (who is also a creator with their own library)
- No other creators yet
- No revenue splitting yet
- No licensing yet

BUT: The database structure is ready for multiple creators and organizations from day one. We're just building the interface for one organization first.

## What Can You Do With Codex?

This section describes each major capability of the platform, organized by what you're trying to accomplish.

### 1. Managing Your Content Library

**What is this?**
Your content library is where you upload and organize all your media files (videos, audio). Think of it like your personal Dropbox, but specifically designed for content creators.

**What you can do:**

- **Upload Videos**: Upload video files (MP4, MOV, WebM) up to 5GB each
  - Videos are stored in your personal storage space
  - You can upload a 30-minute yoga class, a 2-hour workshop, or a 5-minute tip
  - The platform tracks upload progress so you can see how much time is left

- **Upload Audio**: Upload audio files (MP3, WAV) up to 500MB each
  - Perfect for podcasts, guided meditations, or audiobooks
  - Same storage system as videos—it's all your media library

- **Organize Your Library**: See all your uploaded media in one place
  - Sort by date, title, or type (video/audio)
  - Search for specific files
  - See which videos are being used in which content posts
  - Know if a video is still processing or ready to use

- **Reuse Content**: Upload once, use many times
  - Record a video about "Introduction to Mindfulness"
  - Use it in a $5 beginner course
  - Use it again in a $99 complete mindfulness program
  - Use it in a free preview to attract customers
  - The video file only exists once—you just create different "product listings" that reference it

- **Add Metadata**: Add information to help you organize
  - Give each video a title and description (for your own reference)
  - See file size, duration, upload date
  - See status (uploading, processing, ready)

**Why this matters:**
- No duplicate uploads means less storage cost
- You own your files forever—they're not tied to any specific course or organization
- If you create a better version of a video, you can swap it out without recreating all your products

**Example Workflow:**

*Tom the Business Coach*:
1. Records 10 videos about starting a business
2. Uploads all 10 to his media library
3. Creates "Startup Basics" course using videos 1-5 → Sells for $29
4. Creates "Advanced Business Strategy" using videos 6-10 → Sells for $79
5. Later, creates "Complete Entrepreneur Bundle" using ALL 10 videos → Sells for $99
6. All three products reference the same 10 video files—no duplicate uploads

---

### 2. Creating Content to Sell

**What is this?**
Creating "content posts" is how you package your media into products that customers can buy. It's like creating a product listing on Amazon—you're describing what they get and how much it costs.

**What you can do:**

- **Create Content Posts**: Package media into sellable products
  - Choose a video or audio file from your library
  - Write a title and description that customers will see
  - Set a price (or make it free)
  - Choose whether it appears on your personal profile or an organization's storefront
  - Add a custom thumbnail image

- **Organize with Categories**: Group content by topic
  - Create categories like "Beginner Yoga", "Advanced Techniques", "Meditation"
  - Customers can browse by category
  - Helps them find what they're looking for

- **Add Tags**: Make content easier to find
  - Tag a video with "stress relief", "morning routine", "15 minutes"
  - Customers can filter by tags
  - You can have multiple tags per content post

- **Manage Lifecycle**: Control when content is visible
  - **Draft**: You're still working on it—customers can't see it
  - **Published**: Live and available for purchase
  - **Archived**: Not available anymore, but not deleted (you might bring it back)

- **Choose Where It Appears**: Decide who "owns" the storefront
  - Post to your **personal profile**: Appears on your creator page, you control everything
  - Post to an **organization**: Appears in their catalog (like the yoga studio's website)
  - The underlying video is still yours either way

- **Attach Downloadable Resources**: Give customers bonus files
  - Upload a PDF workbook that goes with your video
  - Upload a meditation audio track to accompany a video course
  - Upload exercise templates, checklists, or guides
  - Resources are stored separately and can be reused across multiple content posts

**Example Workflow:**

*Maria the Cooking Teacher*:
1. Uploads a video: "How to Make Perfect Pasta" (30 minutes)
2. Creates content post #1:
   - Title: "Italian Pasta Masterclass"
   - Description: "Learn authentic techniques from my grandmother's recipes"
   - Price: $15
   - Posted to: Her personal profile
   - Attached resource: PDF with 10 pasta recipes
3. Creates content post #2:
   - Title: "Quick Family Dinners: Pasta Edition"
   - Description: "Fast, delicious meals your kids will love"
   - Price: $10
   - Posted to: "Family Cooking Academy" (an organization)
   - Attached resource: Same PDF (reused!)
4. Same video, two different products, two different audiences

---

### 3. Selling Content (E-Commerce)

**What is this?**
The checkout and payment system that lets customers buy your content. This is how money actually changes hands.

**What you can do:**

- **Set Prices**: Decide what each piece of content costs
  - Prices are in your local currency
  - You can charge anything from $0 (free) to thousands of dollars
  - Different products can reference the same video but have different prices

- **Free Content Strategy**: Offer some content for free
  - Use free videos as "lead magnets" to attract customers
  - Once they trust you, they'll buy your paid content
  - Example: Free "Intro to Yoga" video leads to $49 "30-Day Yoga Challenge"

- **Checkout Process**: Customers go through a simple purchase flow
  - They click "Buy" on a content post
  - They're taken to a secure checkout page
  - They enter their payment information (handled by Stripe)
  - They receive instant access after payment

- **Payment Processing**: Money is handled securely
  - Payments processed through Stripe (industry-standard, very secure)
  - Credit cards, debit cards supported
  - Customers aren't charged until they complete checkout
  - Failed payments are handled automatically (customer is notified)

- **Purchase Tracking**: See who bought what
  - View all purchases in the admin dashboard
  - See customer name, what they bought, when, how much
  - Filter by date range, product, customer
  - Track your revenue over time

- **Prevent Duplicate Purchases**: Customers can't accidentally buy twice
  - If they try to buy something they already own, they're notified
  - Prevents frustration and support requests

**How money flows:**
1. Customer pays $50 for your course
2. Stripe takes their fee (~3%): $1.50
3. Platform takes its fee (configurable): $2.50
4. You receive: $46
5. Money arrives in your bank account within 2-7 days (Stripe's standard timeline)

**Example Workflow:**

*Alex the Fitness Coach*:
- Posts "Home Workout Program" for $39
- Sarah (customer) finds it and clicks "Buy Now"
- Sarah enters her credit card information on the secure Stripe checkout page
- Payment succeeds → Sarah immediately gets access to the videos
- Alex sees the purchase in his dashboard: "Sarah Johnson purchased Home Workout Program - $39"
- Stripe deposits $37.83 into Alex's bank account 2 days later (after fees)

---

### 4. Delivering Content to Customers (Content Access)

**What is this?**
Once a customer buys your content, they need to be able to watch or download it. This system handles access control, streaming, and download links.

**What you can do:**

- **Automatic Access Granting**: Customers get instant access after purchase
  - No manual work required
  - Purchase completes → Access is immediately granted
  - Customer can start watching right away

- **Secure Streaming**: Videos are delivered securely
  - Customers can't copy the video file URL and share it with friends
  - Each viewing session gets a unique, expiring link
  - Links expire after 1 hour (customer can refresh for a new link)
  - This prevents unauthorized sharing

- **User Library**: Customers see all their purchased content
  - They log in and see "My Library"
  - All their purchased videos and audio in one place
  - Organized by purchase date (newest first)
  - They can click any item to start watching

- **Progress Tracking**: Resume where you left off
  - Customer watches 15 minutes of a 30-minute video
  - They close their browser
  - Next time they open it, the video starts at the 15-minute mark
  - Progress is saved automatically every 30 seconds
  - Shows "43% complete" on the library page

- **Download Access**: Let customers download files (if you choose)
  - Videos can be downloadable (optional—you decide)
  - Resources (PDFs, audio files) are always downloadable
  - Downloaded files have no expiry—customer keeps them forever
  - Secure download links prevent unauthorized access

- **Multi-Device Support**: Watch anywhere
  - Start watching on laptop, continue on phone
  - Progress syncs across all devices
  - Works on desktop, mobile, tablet

**Example Workflow:**

*Sarah the Customer*:
1. Buys "Complete Yoga Course" with 20 videos
2. Immediately redirected to "My Library"
3. Clicks on Video 1: "Introduction to Yoga"
4. Video streams in her browser (can't download the URL)
5. Watches 10 minutes, then closes laptop
6. Next day: Opens laptop, goes to "My Library"
7. Video 1 shows "32% complete" → Clicks it, resumes at 10 minutes
8. Finishes Video 1, clicks Video 2
9. Downloads the PDF workbook to her computer (downloadable resource)

---

### 5. Managing Your Business (Admin Dashboard)

**What is this?**
Your command center for running your business. See sales, manage customers, control content, and make decisions based on data.

**What you can do:**

**Revenue Analytics:**
- **See total revenue**: How much you've made overall
- **Track revenue over time**: Daily, weekly, monthly breakdowns

- Ranked by revenue, purchase count, or both
- Helps you understand what customers want most
- Decide what to create more of

**Quick Actions:**
- Publish multiple pieces of content at once
- Send access to a customer without them paying (comps, refunds)
- Search for specific customers, purchases, or content quickly

**Example Workflow:**

*Jordan the Course Creator (Monthly Review)*:
1. Logs into admin dashboard
2. Checks revenue analytics: "Made $3,450 this month" (up 20% from last month!)
3. Sees top-performing content: "Beginner Photography Course" is #1 with $1,200 in sales
4. Views customer list: 45 new customers this month
5. Checks purchase history for customer "Emma Wilson": She's bought 3 courses, spent $127 total
6. Decision: Create more photography content since that's selling best
7. Also decision: Reach out to Emma with a personalized discount on the advanced course (she's a good customer!)

---

### 6. Communicating with Customers (Notifications)

**What is this?**
Automated emails that keep customers informed and engaged. You don't have to manually send these—the system handles it.

**What you can do:**

**Purchase Confirmations:**
- Customer buys content → Instant email with receipt
- Email includes:
  - What they bought
  - How much they paid
  - Link to access their content immediately
  - Receipt for their records

**Access Instructions:**
- Email explains how to watch/download
- Direct link to their library
- Simple instructions for first-time users

**Future Capabilities** (Phase 2+):
- Welcome emails for new customers
- Abandoned cart reminders (they almost bought but didn't complete)
- New content announcements (email your existing customers when you release something new)
- Re-engagement campaigns (reach out to inactive customers)

**Example Workflow:**

*Customer Tom buys "Home Workout Program"*:
1. Tom completes purchase at 2:34 PM
2. At 2:34 PM (instantly): Tom receives email: "Thank you for your purchase!"
3. Email contains:
   - "You've purchased: Home Workout Program ($39)"
   - "Click here to start watching immediately"
   - Receipt with date, price, payment method
   - "Questions? Reply to this email"
4. Tom clicks the link → Goes straight to the first workout video
5. He's happy and ready to start working out—no confusion

---

### 7. Configuring Your Platform (Platform Settings)

**What is this?**
Global settings that control how your entire platform works. Think of it as the "preferences" or "configuration" panel for your business.

**What you can do:**

**Business Information:**
- Set your business name (appears everywhere on the site)
- Add your business description
- Upload your logo
- Add contact information (email, phone, address)

**Payment Settings:**

- Test email sending

**Content Defaults:**
- Default content visibility (published or draft)
- Default pricing strategy

**Example Workflow:**

*Lisa sets up her new platform*:
1. Logs in as Platform Owner
2. Goes to "Platform Settings"
3. Updates:
   - Business name: "Mindful Life Coaching"
   - Logo: Uploads her company logo
   - Stripe: Connects her Stripe account
   - Currency: USD
   - Timezone: Pacific Time (PST)
   - From email: "hello@mindfullifecoaching.com"
4. Saves settings
5. Now all purchase confirmation emails come from "hello@mindfullifecoaching.com"
6. All content posts show "Mindful Life Coaching" at the top
7. Revenue dashboard shows USD
8. Everything is branded and professional

---

### 8. Automatic Video Processing (Behind the Scenes)

**What is this?**
When you upload a video or audio file, the platform automatically processes it to make it streamable on any device. This all happens in the background—you don't need to do anything.

**What happens automatically:**

- **Video Conversion to HLS** (HTTP Live Streaming):
  - Your uploaded video is converted into a format that works perfectly on phones, tablets, and computers
  - Multiple quality versions are created automatically (1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p)
  - The video player automatically picks the best quality based on the viewer's internet speed
  - If someone's on WiFi, they get 1080p. If they're on 3G, they get 360p
  - No more buffering or freezing videos!

- **30-Second Preview Clip**:
  - Automatically creates a short preview (first 30 seconds of your video)
  - Customers can watch this preview before purchasing
  - Great for marketing—let them sample your content
  - Works like Netflix or YouTube previews

- **Auto-Generated Thumbnail**:
  - Platform picks a frame from your video (at the 10% mark)
  - Creates a nice thumbnail image customers see before clicking
  - Saves you time—no need to create thumbnails manually
  - You can upload your own custom thumbnail later (Phase 2+)

- **Audio Processing**:
  - Audio files converted to streaming format
  - Volume normalized so all your audio sounds consistent
  - Waveform visualization generated (that cool wave graphic on audio players)
  - Works with podcasts, meditations, audiobooks

**Status tracking:**
- **Uploading**: File is being transferred to storage
- **Processing**: Being converted (usually takes 2-10 minutes depending on file size)
- **Ready**: Done! You can now create content posts using this video
- **Failed**: Something went wrong (corrupted file, unsupported format)

**How long does it take?**
- 1GB video (10 minutes long): ~2-3 minutes to process
- 100MB audio file: ~30 seconds to process
- You'll see real-time progress in your media library

**Example Workflow:**

*Sarah uploads a 45-minute yoga class*:
1. She uploads the video file (2GB, takes 5 minutes to upload)
2. Status shows: "Processing..."
3. Behind the scenes:
   - System creates 4 quality versions (1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p)
   - Generates 30-second preview of the first pose
   - Extracts a nice thumbnail showing Sarah in a yoga pose
4. 4 minutes later, status shows: "Ready!"
5. Sarah creates content post: "Morning Flow - $15"
6. Customers can:
   - Watch the 30-second preview for free
   - See the thumbnail on the browse page
   - Purchase and stream in perfect quality on any device

**Why this matters:**
- You upload once, platform handles all the technical stuff
- Videos work perfectly on every device
- Preview clips help sell more (customers sample before buying)
- No video editing software needed
- Professional streaming quality automatically

**Cost:**
- Processing is included—you don't pay extra
- Uses serverless GPU workers (RunPod) which only charge when actually processing
- Very cheap: ~$0.02 to process a 1GB video

**What you DON'T need to do:**
- Don't manually create different quality versions
- Don't create preview clips yourself
- Don't worry about video formats or codecs
- Don't generate thumbnails (unless you want a custom one)
- Just upload and go!

### Journey 2: Mike's Cooking Academy (Organization with Future Creators)

**Mike's Background:**
- Runs an online cooking school
- Has 5 chef instructors who work with him
- Each chef has their own specialty (Italian, French, Asian, Baking, Grilling)
- Wants to sell courses featuring all chefs

**Phase 1 Reality (What Mike Can Do NOW):**

Mike is the Organization Owner and also a creator:
1. Mike uploads his own 30 cooking videos (Italian cuisine)
2. He creates content posts on his organization's storefront:
   - "Italian Basics" - $19
   - "Pasta Mastery" - $29
   - "Complete Italian Cooking" - $79
3. Mike runs the business solo initially
4. He can't yet feature his other chef instructors (that's Phase 2)

**Phase 2 Vision (What Mike WILL Be Able To Do):**

**Setting Up Multiple Creators:**
1. Mike invites Chef Antoine (French cuisine specialist) to the platform
2. Antoine gets his own creator account
3. Antoine uploads 25 French cooking videos to HIS media library
4. Antoine creates content on the "Cooking Academy" organization:
   - "French Techniques" - $25
   - "Classic French Desserts" - $35
5. Mike (as Organization Owner) sets revenue split: 70% to Antoine, 30% to the Academy
6. When customers buy Antoine's courses, both earn money

**Growing the Team:**
7. Mike invites Chef Yuki (Asian cuisine)
8. Chef Maria (Baking)
9. Chef Tony (Grilling)
10. Each chef uploads their videos to their own library
11. Each chef creates courses on the Academy's storefront

**Creating Bundles:**
12. Mike creates "Complete Cooking Mastery" bundle:
    - Includes content from all 5 chefs
    - Price: $299
    - Revenue split: Each chef gets % based on how much of their content is included
13. Customers get access to 150+ videos from 5 expert chefs

**Customer Experience:**
14. Customer Jen visits "Cooking Academy"
15. She sees courses from multiple chefs
16. She doesn't care who created each video—she just wants to learn cooking
17. She buys "Complete Cooking Mastery" for $299
18. Gets instant access to all 150+ videos
19. Money is automatically split between Mike and the 5 chefs

**Why This Works:**
- Mike runs one storefront, but features multiple creators
- Each chef owns their videos (stored in their own library)
- Chefs can ALSO sell independently on their own profiles
- Example: Chef Antoine sells "French Techniques" on the Academy for $25, AND on his personal profile for $20
- Antoine keeps 70% from Academy sales, 100% from personal sales (minus platform fees)
- Same video, two storefronts, two revenue streams

**Key Lesson**: Organizations are collections of creators who collaborate and share revenue.

### Journey 3: Emma the Course Creator (Licensing Vision)

**Emma's Background:**
- Business coach with popular courses about entrepreneurship
- Has 100 videos about starting and running a business
- Works with 3 different business academies who want to feature her content
- Wants to license her content to multiple organizations

**Phase 1 Reality:**
Emma is a solo creator with her own library, selling on her personal profile only.

**Phase 2+ Vision (Licensing):**

**Emma's Setup:**
1. Emma uploads all 100 videos to her media library
2. She creates courses on her personal profile:

6. Academy creates their own content post:
   - Title: "Tech Startup Fundamentals (feat. Emma Jones)"
   - Price: $79 (higher than Emma's $49 solo price)
   - Posted on Academy's storefront
7. Customer buys from Academy for $79:
   - Academy gets $47.40 (60%)

   - Emma did zero work (content already existed)

**Licensing Deal #2: Women in Business Collective**
8. Another organization wants the same content

    - Women Collective: $59 (she gets 50%)

**Licensing Deal #3: Corporate Training Platform**
13. Corporate platform wants ALL Emma's content for employee training
14. Emma licenses entire library (100 videos)
15. Corporate pays $500/month flat fee
16. Unlimited access for all their employees
17. Emma earns passive income without individual sales

**Why This Works:**
- Emma creates content once, earns from multiple sources
- Organizations get expert content without creating it themselves
- Customers benefit from curated collections from multiple experts
- Everyone wins

**Revenue Example (One Month):**
- Personal profile sales: 10 courses × $49 = $490
- Tech Academy (licensed): 15 sales × $79 × 40% = $474
- Women Collective (licensed): 8 sales × $59 × 50% = $236
- Corporate (licensed): Flat $500/month = $500
- **Total**: $1,700 from content Emma created months ago

**Key Lesson**: Licensing lets creators earn from their content many times over without additional work.

## Phase 1 vs The Future

### Phase 1: What Works Now (MVP)

**Users:**
- 1 Platform Owner (you, the developer)
- 1 Organization Owner (who is also a creator)
- Unlimited customers

**What You Can Do:**
- Upload videos and audio to your media library
- Create content posts with pricing
- Sell content through Stripe checkout
- Deliver content to customers (streaming, downloads)
- Track revenue and customers in admin dashboard
- Send purchase confirmation emails
- Configure platform settings

**Limitations:**
- Only one organization
- Only one creator (the organization owner)
- No additional team members
- No revenue splitting
- No licensing
- No subscriptions (only one-time purchases)

**Why These Limitations?**
- Keeps Phase 1 simple and focused
- Lets us validate the core concept quickly
- Database structure already supports more—we just build UI later
- You can start making money immediately with Phase 1

---

### Phase 2: Multi-Creator Organizations

**New Capabilities:**
- Invite additional creators to your organization
- Each creator has their own media library
- Creators can post to the organization's storefront
- Automatic revenue splitting (configurable per creator)
- Organization Owner controls who can post what

**Example:**
- Yoga studio owner (organization)
- Invites 5 yoga instructors (creators)
- Each instructor uploads their own videos
- All videos appear on studio's website
- Revenue splits automatically: 70% creator, 30% studio

---

### Phase 3: Multi-Organization Platform

**New Capabilities:**
- Platform supports multiple organizations
- Each organization has its own subdomain (yoga-studio.codex.com, cooking-school.codex.com)
- Creators can work with multiple organizations simultaneously
- Central creator profiles (customers can follow individual creators)
- Platform Owner earns from every organization

**Example:**
- Sarah the yoga instructor works with 3 different studios
- Each studio features her content
- She earns from all 3, plus her personal profile
- Customers can find Sarah's content anywhere, or go directly to her profile

---

### Phase 4: Subscriptions & Licensing

**New Capabilities:**
- Monthly subscriptions (unlimited access to content library)
- Licensing deals (creators license content to organizations for a % or flat fee)
- Credit-based system (customers buy credits, spend them on events/content)
- Advanced analytics (customer lifetime value, churn rates, cohort analysis)

**Example:**
- Emma licenses her business courses to 10 different platforms
- Each pays her monthly or per-sale
- She creates once, earns from 10 sources
- Passive income at scale

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to know how to code to use Codex?**
A: No! As a creator or organization owner, you just upload videos, create products, and sell. The platform handles all the technical stuff. (But YOU, the Platform Owner, built this—so you do know how to code!)

**Q: What happens to my content if I leave an organization?**
A: Your media library stays with you forever. The videos are stored in YOUR storage space. If you leave an organization, they lose access to your videos, but you keep them.

**Q: Can I sell the same video at different prices?**
A: Yes! Upload the video once to your library, then create multiple content posts with different prices. Example: Sell "Intro to Yoga" for $10 on your profile, and include it in a $99 bundle on an organization's site.

**Q: How do customers watch the videos after buying?**
A: They log in, go to "My Library", and see all their purchased content. They click a video to start watching. The video streams in their browser—they can't download it (unless you choose to allow downloads).

**Q: Can customers download videos?**
A: You decide! By default, videos stream only (can't be downloaded). But you can enable downloads if you want. Resources (PDFs, workbooks) are always downloadable.

**Q: What if a customer asks for a refund?**
A: You handle refunds through Stripe's dashboard. Once refunded, you can manually revoke the customer's access in the admin dashboard (or leave it—your choice).

**Q: How long does it take to receive money?**
A: Stripe deposits money into your bank account within 2-7 business days after a sale. First payout might take longer (Stripe's security verification).

**Q: Can I offer free content?**
A: Absolutely! Set the price to $0. Free content is a great way to attract customers who then buy your paid content. Example: Free "Intro to Meditation" leads to paid "30-Day Meditation Challenge".

**Q: What file types are supported?**
A: Videos: MP4, MOV, WebM (up to 5GB each). Audio: MP3, WAV (up to 500MB each). Resources: PDF, DOCX, and most document types (up to 100MB each).

**Q: How many videos can I upload?**
A: Unlimited! Storage costs scale with usage, but there's no hard limit.

**Q: Can I edit a video after uploading?**
A: You can't edit the video file itself in Codex, but you can:
- Upload a new version and swap it out
- Update the title, description, price of content posts
- Replace thumbnails

**Q: What happens if my upload fails?**
A: The platform tracks upload progress. If it fails, you can restart from where it left off. Large files (5GB) might take hours on slow internet—be patient!

**Q: Can customers leave reviews or comments?**
A: Not in Phase 1. Phase 3+ will add customer reviews, ratings, and comments.

**Q: Can I bundle content from multiple creators?**
A: Yes, in Phase 2+! You (as organization owner) can create bundles that include content from all your creators. Revenue automatically splits according to each creator's deal.

**Q: How do I market my content?**
A: Codex doesn't include marketing tools (no email campaigns, social media scheduling, etc.). You market externally (Instagram, Facebook, email list) and send people to your Codex storefront.

**Q: Can I import existing customers from another platform?**
A: Not automatically. Customers will need to create new accounts. But you can manually grant them free access to content they've already purchased elsewhere (goodwill gesture).

**Q: Is there a mobile app?**
A: Not yet. Codex works in any web browser (desktop, mobile, tablet). Customers watch in their mobile browser. A native app is possible in the future.

## Glossary

**Creator**: An independent person who uploads media to their own library. They own their content forever and decide how to sell it.

**Organization**: A business or collective that features content from one or more creators. Run by an Organization Owner.

**Organization Owner**: The person who runs an organization. They are ALSO a creator with their own media library.

**Platform Owner**: You—the developer who built and maintains Codex. You have access to everything but don't run businesses on it.

**Customer**: A regular person who buys and consumes content. No special access needed.

**Media Library**: Your personal collection of uploaded videos and audio files. Think of it like Dropbox for content creators.

**Media Item**: A single video or audio file in your media library. Example: "Morning Yoga - 20 minutes.mp4"

**Content Post**: A product listing that packages a media item for sale. It has a title, description, price, and category. Multiple content posts can reference the same media item.

**Personal Profile**: Your individual creator page where you sell content independently. Customers can buy directly from you.

**Organization Storefront**: The website/catalog for an organization. Features content from the organization owner and (in Phase 2+) other creators.

**Draft**: Content that's not published yet. Only you can see it—customers can't.

**Published**: Content that's live and available for customers to purchase.

**Archived**: Content that's been taken offline but not deleted. You might bring it back later.

**Revenue Split**: How money is divided between a creator and organization when the organization sells the creator's content. Example: 60/40 split means creator gets 60%, organization gets 40%.

**Licensing**: When a creator allows an organization to sell their content in exchange for a percentage of sales or flat fee. The creator still owns the media—the organization just has permission to sell it.

**Stripe**: The payment processing company that handles all transactions. Customers' credit card info goes through Stripe (not Codex), which is very secure.

**Platform Fee**: The small percentage you (Platform Owner) take from each sale to cover costs and make money. Configurable, usually 5-10%.

**Presigned URL**: A temporary, secure link that lets customers watch or download content. Links expire after a set time (usually 1 hour) to prevent sharing.

**Streaming**: When customers watch videos in their browser without downloading the file. Like Netflix—video plays, but they don't get a file.

**Progress Tracking**: The system remembers where customers stopped watching and lets them resume later.

**Admin Dashboard**: The control panel where creators and organization owners manage their business. See sales, customers, content, analytics.

**Resource**: A downloadable file (PDF, workbook, template) attached to content. Example: A meditation course might include a PDF journal.

**Checkout Session**: The page where customers enter payment info and complete a purchase. Handled by Stripe for security.

## Final Thoughts

Codex is designed to grow with your needs:

- **Start simple** (Phase 1): One creator, upload content, start selling
- **Grow your team** (Phase 2): Add creators, split revenue, build a collective
- **Scale your business** (Phase 3): Multiple organizations, licensing deals, passive income
- **Optimize for profit** (Phase 4): Subscriptions, analytics, advanced monetization

The key principle: **Creators own their content forever.** Organizations are partners who help sell and market, but they never own the creator's media files.

Whether you're a solo yoga instructor, a business coach, or running an online academy with 50 instructors, Codex gives you the tools to monetize knowledge without needing to be technical.

**You focus on creating great content. Codex handles the rest.**
