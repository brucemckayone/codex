## 🗂️ Database Branching Strategy

### Current Implementation

Based on `.github/workflows/testing.yml` lines 72-95:

**PR Events:**
```bash
Branch Name: pr-{number}
Example: pr-8
Parent: production
Reused: Yes (if PR updated)
```

**Push Events (non-PR):**
```bash
Branch Name: push-{branch-name}-{short-sha}
Example: push-feature-auth-a1b2c3d4
Parent: production
Truncated: 63 chars (Neon limit)
```

### ✅ What's Working Correctly

1. **Each PR gets its own isolated database branch** (`pr-8`, `pr-9`, etc.)
2. **All PR branches inherit from `production`** (not from each other)
3. **Branches are reused** when PR is updated (no duplicate branches)
4. **Automatic cleanup** when PR is closed

### Key Configuration

```yaml
# testing.yml lines 87-95
- name: Create Neon branch
  uses: neondatabase/create-branch-action@v5
  with:
    project_id: ${{ vars.NEON_PROJECT_ID }}
    branch_name: pr-{number}
    parent: production           # ← Always branches from production
    username: neondb_owner
    api_key: ${{ secrets.NEON_API_KEY }}
```

## 🚀 Worker Deployment Strategy

### Preview Deployments (Per PR)

**Current Setup:**
- ✅ Creates DNS records dynamically via Cloudflare API
- ✅ Deploys workers with unique names: `*-preview-{PR}`
- ✅ Uses Worker Routes with custom domains
- ✅ Automatic cleanup on PR close

**Worker Names:**
```
stripe-webhook-handler-preview-8
auth-worker-preview-8
codex-web-preview-8
```

**URLs (After DNS creation):**
```
https://api-preview-8.revelations.studio
https://auth-preview-8.revelations.studio
https://codex-preview-8.revelations.studio
```

**DNS Records Created:**
- `api-preview-{PR}.revelations.studio` → CNAME → `revelations.studio` (proxied)
- `auth-preview-{PR}.revelations.studio` → CNAME → `revelations.studio` (proxied)
- `codex-preview-{PR}.revelations.studio` → CNAME → `revelations.studio` (proxied)

### Production Deployment

**From:** `.github/workflows/testing.yml` lines 283-306

**Trigger:** Push to `main` after tests pass

**Worker Names:**
```
stripe-webhook-handler-production
auth-worker-production
codex-web-production
```

**URLs:**
```
https://api.revelations.studio
https://auth.revelations.studio
https://codex.revelations.studio
```

## 🔍 Important Questions to Verify

### 1. ⚠️ Multiple PRs at Once

**Question:** Can multiple preview environments coexist?

**Current Status:** ✅ **YES**
- Each PR gets unique database branch: `pr-7`, `pr-8`, `pr-9`
- Each PR gets unique workers: `*-preview-7`, `*-preview-8`, `*-preview-9`
- Each PR gets unique DNS records

**Example:**
```
PR #7:
  - DB: pr-7
  - Workers: *-preview-7
  - URLs: *-preview-7.revelations.studio

PR #8:
  - DB: pr-8
  - Workers: *-preview-8
  - URLs: *-preview-8.revelations.studio
```

### 2. ⚠️ Database Isolation

**Question:** Are preview databases truly isolated from production?

**Current Status:** ✅ **YES**
- Preview branches created from `production` (not main branch)
- Changes in preview don't affect production
- Each preview is independent

**From testing.yml:**
```yaml
parent: production  # Line 93 - Always branches from production
```

### 3. ⚠️ Cleanup Verification Needed

**Question:** Does cleanup actually delete DNS records?

**Current Status:** ⚠️ **IMPLEMENTED BUT UNTESTED**

**Cleanup Workflow** (`.github/workflows/preview-deploy.yml` lines 27-74):
1. ✅ Deletes Neon branch
2. ✅ Deletes worker deployments
3. ✅ Calls DNS deletion script
4. ⚠️ **Need to verify DNS records are actually deleted**

**To Verify:**
```bash
# After closing a PR, check if DNS records are gone
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/${ZONE_ID}/dns_records?name=codex-preview-8.revelations.studio" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}"
```

### 4. ⚠️ PR Comment Accuracy

**Issue:** PR comments showing incorrect URLs

**Current Status:** ⚠️ **WORKFLOW_RUN LIMITATION**
- Preview deployment workflow runs from `main` branch
- Changes to workflow file only take effect after merge
- Comments generated using old workflow code

**Solution:** Merge PR #8 to main, then test with new PR

## 🎨 Environment Lifecycle

### Preview Environment (PR Lifecycle)

```
PR Opened
    ↓
Testing Workflow (testing.yml)
    ├─ Create Neon branch: pr-{number}
    ├─ Run migrations
    ├─ Run tests
    └─ Upload artifact (DATABASE_URL)
    ↓
Preview Deployment (preview-deploy.yml)
    ├─ Create DNS records (3 domains)
    ├─ Deploy stripe-webhook-handler
    ├─ Deploy auth-worker
    ├─ Deploy codex-web
    └─ Post PR comment with URLs
    ↓
Development & Testing
    ↓
PR Closed/Merged
    ↓
Cleanup (preview-deploy.yml)
    ├─ Delete Neon branch
    ├─ Delete worker deployments
    ├─ Delete DNS records
    └─ Post cleanup comment
```

### Production Environment (Main Branch)

```
Merge to Main
    ↓
Testing Workflow
    ├─ Create ephemeral test branch
    ├─ Run tests
    └─ Delete test branch
    ↓
Deploy Workers (testing.yml lines 283-306)
    ├─ Deploy stripe-webhook-handler-production
    ├─ Deploy auth-worker-production
    ├─ Deploy codex-web-production
    └─ Use DATABASE_URL from production Neon branch
```

## 🔧 Required Secrets & Variables

### GitHub Secrets (Already Set)

```
✅ CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
✅ CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID
✅ NEON_API_KEY
✅ NEON_PROJECT_ID
❓ CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID  # ← Need to verify this is set!
```

### Get Cloudflare Zone ID

```bash
# Method 1: Via Dashboard
# Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com → Select domain → Overview → Zone ID (right sidebar)

# Method 2: Via API
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones?name=revelations.studio" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}" \
  | jq -r '.result[0].id'
```

**Action Required:** Add `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID` to GitHub Secrets if not already set

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

### ✅ What's Correct

1. **Database isolation is solid**
   - Each PR gets its own branch from production
   - Multiple PRs can coexist safely
   - No cross-contamination possible

2. **Worker isolation is solid**
   - Each PR gets uniquely named workers
   - No conflicts between preview environments
   - Automatic cleanup removes old workers

3. **Architecture follows best practices**
   - Preview environments are ephemeral
   - Production is protected
   - Clear separation of concerns

### ⚠️ What Needs Verification

1. **DNS record management**
   - Creation: Implemented but untested
   - Deletion: Implemented but untested
   - Need to verify Cloudflare Zone ID is set

2. **PR comment accuracy**
   - Will be fixed after merging PR #8
   - Current limitation is workflow_run behavior

3. **End-to-end testing**
   - Create PR → Deploy → Test → Close → Verify cleanup
   - Test with multiple simultaneous PRs

---

## 📝 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Verify CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID secret is set**
   ```bash
   gh secret list | grep CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID
   ```

2. **Test DNS creation on PR #8**
   - Check Cloudflare dashboard for DNS records
   - Try accessing the preview URLs
   - Verify SSL/TLS works (should via Cloudflare proxy)

3. **Test cleanup by closing PR #8 (after testing)**
   - Verify all DNS records deleted
   - Verify all workers deleted
   - Verify Neon branch deleted

### Future Improvements

1. **Add health checks** to preview environments
2. **Add preview URL to GitHub status checks**
3. **Consider staging environment** (persistent, not ephemeral)
4. **Add monitoring** for orphaned resources

## 🚨 Critical Configuration Points

### Neon Branch Parent

**Location:** `.github/workflows/testing.yml:93`
```yaml
parent: production  # ← CRITICAL: All previews branch from production
```

**Why Important:**
- Ensures preview environments have production schema
- Prevents cascading branch dependencies
- Makes previews independent of each other

### DNS Script Zone ID

**Location:** `.github/workflows/preview-deploy.yml:97`
```yaml
${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID }}  # ← CRITICAL: Must be set
```

**Why Important:**
- Required for DNS record creation/deletion
- Without it, preview URLs won't work
- Workflow will fail if not set

### Worker Route Patterns

**Location:** `.github/workflows/preview-deploy.yml:143, 189, 222`
```yaml
--route "api-preview-${{ env.PR_NUMBER }}.revelations.studio/*"
```

**Why Important:**
- Must match DNS records created
- `/*` suffix is required for Worker Routes
- Subdomain must be unique per PR

**Next Steps:** Test DNS creation → Verify cleanup → Merge to main → Test with new PR
