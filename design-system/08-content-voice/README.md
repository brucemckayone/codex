# 08. Content & Voice

**Words that welcome. How language creates belonging.**

---

## Foundation

This document extends the philosophy from [01. Philosophy](../01-philosophy/README.md) into language.

Every word must answer: **Does this make the reader feel like a member of a community, or a customer in a transaction?**

---

## Voice Philosophy

### Words as Welcome

In creative studios, language matters:

| Space | Language Character |
|-------|-------------------|
| Yoga studio | Warm, encouraging, inviting to join the practice |
| Dance company | Inclusive, celebrating the ensemble |
| Music school | Supportive, focused on the journey |
| Art collective | Collaborative, we're in this together |

**Codex voice embodies**: Warm, clear, welcoming, professional.

---

### The Voice Spectrum

```
Cold ◄──────────────────────────────────────────────► Casual

Corporate   Formal   Neutral  ║ Codex ║  Friendly   Chatty
Legal       Stiff    Generic  ║       ║  Warm       Slang
    │          │         │    ║       ║    │           │
    └──────────┴─────────┴────╨───────╨────┴───────────┘
                              ▲
                        We live here
```

**Codex voice is:**
- Warmer than corporate (not stiff or formal)
- More professional than chatty (not "Hey! 🎉")
- Clear above all else
- Welcoming, like a good host

---

### Core Voice Principles

1. **Community Over Transaction**
   - "Members" not "customers"
   - "Join" not "buy"
   - "Library" not "purchases"
   - See [Language Guide](#language-guide) below

2. **Clear Over Clever**
   - Understanding > creativity
   - Function > personality
   - If someone might misunderstand, rewrite

3. **Warm Professionalism**
   - Helpful colleague, not HR department
   - Friendly expert, not cold system
   - Human, but not trying too hard

4. **Action-Oriented**
   - Tell people what to do
   - Show the path forward
   - Never leave someone stuck

---

## Language Guide

**This is non-negotiable.** These terms align with our mission.

### Core Terms

| ❌ Don't Use | ✅ Use Instead | Why |
|-------------|----------------|-----|
| Buy | Join, Get access | Joining a community, not shopping |
| Purchase | Join, Get access | Same reason |
| Customer | Member | They belong, they don't just transact |
| Product | Offering, Content | Not a commodity |
| Shopping cart | (no equivalent) | No shopping metaphor at all |
| Checkout | Complete, Continue | Not a store |
| Order | Access, Membership | Not a transaction |
| Your purchases | Your library | Collections you belong to |
| Sell | Share, Offer | Creators share with their community |
| Price | Access level, Contribution | Framing matters |
| Consumer | Member, Learner | Active participant, not passive consumer |

### Context-Specific Terms

| Context | ❌ Avoid | ✅ Prefer |
|---------|---------|----------|
| After payment | "Order complete" | "Welcome to [Collective]" |
| Content access | "You purchased this" | "In your library" |
| Creator dashboard | "Sales" | "New members" |
| Revenue | "Total sales" | "Community earnings" |
| Metrics | "Customers acquired" | "Members joined" |

### Example Transformations

**Transaction-focused → Community-focused:**

```
❌ "Add to cart"
✅ "Get access"

❌ "Complete purchase"
✅ "Join now"

❌ "Thank you for your purchase!"
✅ "Welcome to the community!"

❌ "View your orders"
✅ "Your library"

❌ "12 customers bought this course"
✅ "12 members have joined"

❌ "Best seller"
✅ "Community favorite" (or just don't rank)
```

---

## Tone by Context

### Success States

**Tone:** Warm, brief, celebratory without excess.

```
✅ Good:
"Welcome to Mindful Movement"
"You're in. Here's what to explore first."
"Content published"
"Changes saved"

❌ Avoid:
"Yay! Success! 🎉" (too casual)
"Transaction complete" (transactional)
"Awesome job!" (patronizing)
```

---

### Error States

**Tone:** Calm, helpful, specific, actionable.

**Structure:** [What happened] + [Why if known] + [What to do]

```
✅ Good:
"Upload failed: File exceeds 5GB limit.
Try compressing the video or splitting into parts."

"We couldn't process that. Check your connection and try again."

"Email already registered. Sign in instead?"

❌ Avoid:
"Error 0x4A2B" (meaningless)
"Upload failed" (no guidance)
"Oops! Something went wrong 😅" (wrong tone)
"Error" (useless)
```

---

### Warning States

**Tone:** Clear, specific about consequences, not alarming.

```
✅ Good:
"Delete this offering?
Members who have access will lose it permanently."

"Unpublishing will hide this from your community.
Existing members keep their access."

❌ Avoid:
"Are you sure?" (vague)
"This cannot be undone" (obvious, unhelpful alone)
"WARNING!" (alarming)
```

---

### Empty States

**Tone:** Encouraging, show the path forward.

**Structure:** [What's empty] + [Why it matters] + [Action]

```
✅ Good:
"Your library is empty

Join a Collective to start your journey.

[Explore offerings]"

---

"No offerings yet

Share your knowledge with your community.

[Create your first offering]"

❌ Avoid:
"Nothing here" (unhelpful)
"No data" (cold)
"0 results" (just a number)
```

---

### Onboarding

**Tone:** Welcoming, clear, guiding.

```
✅ Good:
"Welcome to Codex

You're joining a community of creators who
share knowledge and grow together.

Let's set up your Collective."

---

"Welcome to [Collective Name]

Here's how to make the most of your membership."

❌ Avoid:
"Hey there! Ready to crush it? Let's go! 🚀" (wrong tone)
"Step 1 of 7" (focus on journey, not steps)
"Complete your profile to unlock features" (transactional)
```

---

## Microcopy Standards

### Button Labels

**Rule:** Verb + specific object. Say what happens.

```
✅ Good:
"Save changes"
"Publish offering"
"Join this Collective"
"Start your journey"
"Create offering"

❌ Avoid:
"Submit" (vague)
"OK" (meaningless)
"Click here" (redundant)
"Save" (what are we saving?)
"Go" (where?)
```

### Confirmation Buttons (Destructive)

**Rule:** Match the label to the consequence.

```
✅ Good:
"Cancel" / "Delete offering"
"Keep editing" / "Discard changes"
"Stay here" / "Leave page"

❌ Avoid:
"No" / "Yes" (unclear what yes means)
"Cancel" / "OK" (OK what?)
```

---

### Form Labels

**Rule:** Short, specific, no punctuation.

```
✅ Good:
"Offering title"
"Description"
"Access level"
"Your email"

❌ Avoid:
"Title:" (no colon)
"Please enter your email" (not a sentence)
"Email Address*" (asterisk handled elsewhere)
```

---

### Placeholder Text

**Rule:** Example content, not instructions.

```
✅ Good:
Label: "Offering title"
Placeholder: "Introduction to Mindful Breathing"

Label: "Description"
Placeholder: "What will members learn?"

❌ Avoid:
Placeholder: "Enter title here" (instruction, not example)
Placeholder: "Required" (that's not an example)
```

---

### Helper Text

**Rule:** Useful guidance, not obvious statements.

```
✅ Good:
"This appears on your offering's card"
"Members see this when browsing"
"Keep it under 60 characters for best display"

❌ Avoid:
"Enter the title" (obvious)
"This field is required" (show, don't tell)
```

---

### Error Messages

**Format:** [Field] [problem]. [Solution or example]

```
✅ Good:
"Email isn't valid. Try: name@example.com"
"Title is required"
"Description is too long. Keep it under 500 characters."
"That email is already registered. Sign in instead?"

❌ Avoid:
"Invalid input"
"Error"
"Field required"
"Validation failed"
```

---

## Formatting Rules

### Capitalization

**Sentence case** for almost everything:
```
"Save your changes"
"Create a new offering"
"Your library"
```

**Title Case** only for:
- Page titles
- Product name (Codex)
- Proper nouns

**NEVER ALL CAPS:**
- Feels aggressive
- Harder to read
- Accessibility issue

---

### Punctuation

**Periods:** Complete sentences only
```
✅ "Your changes have been saved."
❌ "Save Changes." (not a sentence)
```

**Exclamation marks:** Sparingly, for genuine celebration
```
✅ "Welcome to Mindful Movement!"
❌ "Error!" (not a celebration)
❌ "Save Changes!" (not exciting)
```

**Question marks:** When actually asking
```
✅ "Delete this offering?"
✅ "What's your email?"
❌ "Enter email?" (not a question)
```

---

### Numbers

```
Under 10:     Spell out ("three offerings")
10 and over:  Numerals ("12 offerings")
Large:        Abbreviate ("1.2K members")
Money:        Symbol prefix ("$29", not "29 USD")
Percentages:  No space ("10%", not "10 %")
```

---

## Community-Focused Copy Examples

### Welcome Message (After Joining)

```
❌ Transaction-focused:
"Thank you for your purchase!
Order #12345
Receipt has been sent to your email."

✅ Community-focused:

```

---

### Creator Dashboard

```
❌ Transaction-focused:
"Total Sales: $2,340
12 orders this month

✅ Community-focused:
"Your Community

23 members joined this month
$2,340 in community earnings

```

## Length Constraints

Brevity aids clarity. Mobile screens and translations need room.

```
Element              Max Characters    Notes
───────────────────────────────────────────────
Button label         25                Verb + object
Page title           40                Clear and specific
Toast message        80                One glance readable
Error message        120               Problem + solution
Empty state          200               Context + action
Modal body           300               Essential info only
```

**Why?** Text expands 30-40% in translation. Mobile screens are small.

---

## Internationalization

### Avoid

- **Idioms:** "Piece of cake" doesn't translate
- **Slang:** "Awesome," "cool" vary by region
- **Cultural refs:** US-centric assumptions
- **Humor:** Rarely translates well
- **Wordplay:** Puns don't work across languages

### Use

- **Simple vocabulary:** Common words
- **Active voice:** Easier to translate
- **Complete sentences:** Context for translators
- **Consistent terms:** Same word for same concept

---

## Voice Checklist

Every piece of copy must pass:

```
□ Community language?  (Members, not customers)
□ Clear?               (Understood without explanation)
□ Warm?                (Welcoming, not cold)
□ Direct?              (No unnecessary words)
□ Active?              (Subject does action)
□ Actionable?          (User knows what to do)
□ Appropriate tone?    (Matches the context)
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Wrong | What Instead |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| "Customer" | Transactional | "Member" |
| "Purchase" / "Buy" | Shopping language | "Join" / "Get access" |
| "Oops!" | Too casual, deflects | State the issue clearly |
| "Error" | Useless | Explain what happened |
| "Click here" | Redundant, inaccessible | Describe the action |
| ALL CAPS | Aggressive, hard to read | Sentence case |
| Exclamation overuse | Unprofessional | Reserve for genuine celebration |
| Passive voice | Unclear, wordy | Active voice |

---

## The Warmth Test

Before shipping any copy:

1. **Does it use community language?** Members, not customers
2. **Does it feel welcoming?** Like a good host
3. **Is it clear?** No confusion possible
4. **Is it helpful?** Shows the path forward
5. **Is it warm but professional?** Not cold, not too casual

If any answer is no → rewrite.

---

## Living Document

Voice evolves with the community. Changes require:

1. Examples demonstrating the change
2. Alignment check with mission
3. Review for consistency
4. Update all affected copy

| Date | Change | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 2026-01-01 | Initial voice guide | Foundation |
| 2026-01-03 | Complete rewrite | Alignment with Mission. Added community language guide, transformed all examples from transactional to community-focused. |

---

## Summary

**Codex voice in one breath:**

> Every word welcomes. We speak of members, not customers. We invite people to join, not buy. Our language creates belonging—warm, clear, professional. Words are the first handshake with our community.

**The test:**

> Does this copy make someone feel like they're joining a beloved yoga studio, or shopping on Amazon?

If yoga studio → ship it.
If Amazon → rewrite with community language.
