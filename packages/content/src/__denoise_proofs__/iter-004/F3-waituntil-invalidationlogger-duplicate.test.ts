/**
 * Denoise iter-004 F3 — proof test for
 * `types:type-duplicate-cross-package` — `WaitUntilFn` and
 * `InvalidationLogger` are declared (and publicly exported from the
 * package barrel) in two packages with structurally identical shapes.
 *
 * Finding:
 *   - packages/content/src/services/content-invalidation.ts:101,107
 *       export type WaitUntilFn = (promise: Promise<unknown>) => void;
 *       export interface InvalidationLogger {
 *         warn: (message: string, context?: Record<string, unknown>) => void;
 *         info?: (message: string, context?: Record<string, unknown>) => void;
 *       }
 *   - packages/subscription/src/services/subscription-invalidation.ts:70,76
 *       export type WaitUntilFn = (promise: Promise<unknown>) => void;
 *       export interface InvalidationLogger {
 *         warn: (message: string, context?: Record<string, unknown>) => void;
 *       }
 *
 * Both are exported through each package's barrel:
 *   - packages/content/src/index.ts:67-68 → InvalidationLogger, WaitUntilFn
 *   - packages/subscription/src/index.ts:68,71 → type InvalidationLogger, type WaitUntilFn
 *
 * `WaitUntilFn` is structurally identical. `InvalidationLogger` shares the
 * `warn` member but @codex/content also adds an optional `info` — so they
 * are NOT structurally identical, just close. A consumer typed against the
 * subscription variant cannot pass it to the content variant if the
 * content code calls `logger.info(...)` (no compile error today because
 * `info` is optional, but documents intent confusion).
 *
 * Both types are infrastructure plumbing for cache invalidation helpers.
 * They belong in `@codex/cache` (the package that owns `VersionedCache`),
 * or in `@codex/shared-types` as a cross-cutting "fire-and-forget" helper
 * type. Today they are duplicated because the two service packages are
 * trying to stay foundation-free.
 *
 * Rule (ref 02 §7 row 4 / ref 07 §7 row 5): same name declared in 2+
 * packages, both publicly exported.
 *
 * Proof shape: type-equality assertion via `expectTypeOf` (Catalogue
 * row 3 — Type-equality test). For `WaitUntilFn` the assertion passes
 * today (true structural equivalence); for `InvalidationLogger` the
 * proof is that the two are NOT identical — so the test asserts the
 * subset relationship and explicitly notes which member differs.
 *
 * Severity: minor (no runtime impact; doc-rot in package boundaries).
 *
 * Remove the `.skip()` modifier in the same PR as consolidation.
